DFS & BFS Algorithms

## Abstract

Our project aims at simulating graph traversal techniques using BFS and DFS algorithms.

1. The DFS algorithm works as follows:
    - a. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
    - b. Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
    - c. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of stack.
    - d. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.

2. The BFS algorithm works as follows:
    - a. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices at the back of a queue.
    - b. Take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
    - c. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the back of the queue.
    - d. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty.
